# Drinking_Water_Quality

This data set has been used to test the quality of drinking water in NYC. This data could show
results of how good the water filtration systems in certain areas are and could help catch and
solve problems with drinking water. Due to this, the data is highly significant, and analyzing it
could help catch problems before they become out of control or just give a nice insight into how
the water filtration system in NYC works.
